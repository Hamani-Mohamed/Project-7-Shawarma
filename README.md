# 🥙 Shawarma Order System (My First Ever C# WinForms Project!)

A simple C# Windows Forms application that allows users to customize and place a shawarma order.
The app dynamically calculates the total price based on selected size, type, extras, sauces, and dining option.
This project is part of the Abu-Hadhoud Platform training track with Dr. Muhammed Abu Hadhoud.

## 🧠 How It Works

Each option (size, extras, sauces, etc.) has a predefined price.

Whenever the user changes a selection, the total price is recalculated.

The order summary labels update in real time.

Once the order is placed:

All controls are disabled

A confirmation message is displayed

The reset button restores default values and enables all controls again.
